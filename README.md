# New York CitiBike Demand & Allocation Analysis
**Project Overview**

This project analyzes New York CitiBike usage patterns, identifies demand trends, and provides predictive and prescriptive insights to optimize bike allocation across stations. Using historical data from June 1, 2017 to May 31, 2018, the analysis explores factors influencing demand, such as time of day, day of week, weather, and socio-economic factors.

The goal is to determine the optimal number of bikes to allocate at the start of the day for each station to maximize daily trips and improve service efficiency.

 **Key Analyses**
 
Descriptive Analysis:
Reviewed utilization trends by trip duration, payment type, and access method.
Identified seasonal, weekly, and daily demand variations.
Visualized demand distribution with histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots.
Explored correlations between demand and weather or income levels.

Predictive Analysis:
Developed demand forecasting models to guide initial bike distribution.
Applied optimization models (Excel Solver) to balance supply with demand.
Recommended strategic allocation plans for efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Prescriptive Analysis
Used predictive results to recommend targeted bike allocations.
Proposed dynamic rebalancing for real-time adjustments.
Offered operational strategies to prevent shortages during peak times.

**Our Recommendations**

Increase Bike Supply to meet high demand.
Implement Dynamic Rebalancing using real-time demand data.
Use Optimization Tools (Excel Solver) for efficient bike distribution.
Monitor Special Events & Weather to anticipate demand shifts.
Enhance User Experience with continuous feedback loops.

**Tools & Technologies**

R for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization (ggplot2, dplyr).
Microsoft Excel For Solver
Excel Solver for optimization modeling.
RMarkdown for reproducible reporting.
